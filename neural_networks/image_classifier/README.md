# Image Classification Project

This project is the final project for this module, Neural Networks with Tensorflow.

The first part of the project is snapshotting the data, training a model based on that data, and finally predicting images using the trained network and achieving an accuracy of `>70%` with the test data. The model is saved as `HDF5` format (look for a file with `.h5` extension within this directory, like for example, `1725545374.h5`.

// TODO: Add more details.

To achieve the same results, install the dependencies mentioned in `environment.yml` file. This file is an extract from the local virtual environment by using `$ conda env export > environment.yml`.
